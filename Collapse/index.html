  	<h4 class = "html">HTML</h4>
  	<p class = "dispHtml">HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by tags. HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on.
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.

  	<h4>CSS</h4>
  	<p class = "dispCss">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

  <div class = "js">
  	<h4>Javascript</h4>
  	<p class = "dispJs">JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:<br>

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages.<br>

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages. <br>

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages. <br>
   Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
